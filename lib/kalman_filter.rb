# A Ruby implimentation of a Kalman Filter, linear quadratic estimator.
# Noisy sensor data, approximations in the equations that
# describe the system evolution, and external factors that are not accounted
# for all place limits on how well it is possible to determine the system's
# state. The Kalman filter deals effectively with the uncertainty due to
# noisy sensor data and to some extent also with random external factors.
# The Kalman filter produces an estimate of the state of the system as an
# average of the system's predicted state and of the new measurement using a
# weighted average. The purpose of the weights is that values with better
# (i.e., smaller) estimated uncertainty are "trusted" more. The weights
# are calculated from the covariance, a measure of the estimated uncertainty
# of the prediction of the system's state. The result of the weighted
# average is a new state estimate that lies between the predicted and
# measured state, and has a better estimated uncertainty than either alone.
# This process is repeated at every time step, with the new estimate and its
# covariance informing the prediction used in the following iteration. This
# means that the Kalman filter works recursively and requires only the last
# "best guess", rather than the entire history, of a system's state to
# calculate a new state.
